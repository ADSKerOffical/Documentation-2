                 • repeat, break, untill •
• In addition to cycles, there are other cycles which I will now talk about •
• Let's figure it out, first script: •

local count = 0
repeat
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
until count == 5

• This script is very similar to the function "for i = 1, 4 do" •
• You can also add a delay to the script •

local count = 0
repeat
  wait(1)
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
until count == 5

• let's deal with the following situation •
• For example, we want the script to stop working after three uses •
• Therefore we use "break" to make the script stop working: •

local count = 0
repeat
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
    if count == 3 then
        break
    end
until count == 5

• Well, you can also make an loop: •

local Count = 1
repeat
  wait(0.1)
    print(Count)
    Count = Count + 1
until false

• The delay is mandatory because if you don’t set a delay the game crash •
